It was a step your great grandparents took actually. My uncle from that generation said, "There was lots of work. Just no money to pay anyone to do it." When my uncle told me this story he was actually talking about today. He was comparing conditions today for some people in Ontario to conditions in those days. A step that "us people" took in those days was to form credit unions.

this is my good doggy (a picture that looks justt like her). Hanging out.
